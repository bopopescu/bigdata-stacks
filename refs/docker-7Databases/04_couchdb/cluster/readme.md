# CouchDB Clustering

Based on the work done by cacois [here](https://github.com/cacois/couchdb-docker-clustering-examples/blob/master/setup.sh)

We use a cutom-built Docker image to handle the cookie - it needs to be identical AND must only be accessible by the user running couchdb (Windows is terrible at this at runtime)
